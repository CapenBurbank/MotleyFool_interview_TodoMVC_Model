## Installation

Clone the repository into your code editor, you should see an index.html file, right click and copy path, then paste and load that path in your browser.

## Implemented Feature

> Feature: Adding priority to todo list items, and having the functionality to view a list sorted in descending priority, where the most urgent
>          items will render at the top of the list, and the least urgent items will render at the bottom of the list.
<br>
In the updated version of the TodoMVC I have implemented the priority feature. If you click on the icon to the right, that looks like a document with an exclamation 
point next to it, you will find a small dropdown box titled priority with three buttons.
<br>
These buttons are red, yellow, and green circles, that are labeled with text identifying their values
<br>
red button: High  
yellow button: Medium  
green button: Low
